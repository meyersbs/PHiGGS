# PHiGGS - (P)ython (Hi)erarchical (G)raph (G)enerating (S)ystem

PHiGGS is the result of my frustration with the inability of existing graphing tools to generate family tree diagrams that support (1) multiple parents, (2) spouse-to-spouse connections, and (3) hierarchical structures. After two weeks of exhaustive searching, I couldn't find anything that met my needs, so here I am writing a Python 3 framework for generating directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that look like hierarchical tree diagrams.
